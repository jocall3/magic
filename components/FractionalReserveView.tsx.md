            Article XXIX is the cornerstone of value creation within this simulated economy. It establishes two fundamental truths:
            1. The Principle of Credit Expansion: A deposit is not merely stored; it is leveraged. An initial deposit of 100 units, under the 10% reserve ratio, enables the creation of ${expansion} units of new credit throughout the system.
            2. The Principle of Interest on Principal: This newly created credit is not without cost. A loan of 100 units creates a repayment obligation of ${100 + interest} units, ensuring the system's own sustenance and growth.
            Together, these form the Assembly Layer, the process by which raw deposits are assembled into the complex financial instruments of the modern economy.
