# The Weight of Your Name

This is the measure of your word, the resonance of your integrity in the shared world. It is not a score, but a history of promises kept. It is the quantifiable echo of your reliability. To tend to this is to tend to the strength of your own name, ensuring that when you speak, the world knows it can trust the substance behind the sound.
