# The Security: The Citadel

**(This is not a settings page. This is The Citadel, the high-security foundation of your creative workshop. It is here that the walls are fortified, the sentinels are posted, and the keys to your work are managed. This is the seat of your control.)**

The `SecurityView` is the manifestation of a core principle: that your work is valuable, and that valuable work requires unimpeachable security. This is not about mere password management; it is about the conscious and deliberate control of access, identity, and data. To enter The Citadel is to take up the duties of the sovereign, overseeing the defense of your own domain.

This view is a testament to transparency. The `Security Event Timeline` is not just a log; it is a watchtower, providing a clear view of every attempt to access your workshop, successful or not. It shows you the `device`, the `location`, the `timestamp`—the complete tactical data of your digital perimeter. It transforms the invisible act of logging in into a visible, verifiable event.

The Citadel is also the chamber of treaties. The `Linked Accounts` section lists the data-sharing agreements you have forged with other institutions. Here, you are the master of your own data. You hold the absolute power to `unlink` an account, severing the connection and revoking access instantly. This is a powerful expression of data ownership, a constant reminder that you are the sole arbiter of who is granted access to your information.

Finally, this is the armory. The `Security Settings` are the levers of power that control the very mechanics of your defense. Enabling `Two-Factor Authentication` is like adding a second, higher wall around your keep. Activating `Biometric Login` is like tuning the locks to respond only to your own living essence. The `ChangePasswordModal` is the rite of changing the master keys. Each toggle, each button, is a strategic decision that hardens your defenses and reaffirms your command. To be in The Citadel is to be the active, vigilant guardian of your own creative work.
