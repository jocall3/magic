# The Atlas of Assets

This is the observatory's detailed star chart. It is not just a list of your holdings, but a multi-dimensional, interactive map of your entire investment cosmos. Its purpose is to allow you to explore the composition of your power, filtering by asset class or region, to gain a deeper strategic understanding of your arsenal of growth.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Cartographer's Table

(The main observatory shows you the constellation of your wealth. But a true commander needs more than a simple star chart. They need an atlas. A collection of maps that can be filtered, sorted, and studied from any angle. This `PortfolioExplorerView` is that atlas.)

(Its core instrument is the `Treemap`. It is a powerful visualization, a map of your dominion where the size of each territory is proportional to its power—its value. But its true strength lies in its dynamism. With a click, you can redraw the map, filtering to see only your holdings in 'North America', or only your 'Digital Assets'. You are not just viewing data; you are exploring it.)

(The AI's role here is subtle but crucial. It is the master cartographer, the one who knows how to draw the maps. Its logic is 'Proportional Visualization.' When you filter your assets, the AI doesn't just remove items from a list. It recalculates the entire map, resizing every territory to show its new proportional value within the filtered view. It ensures that every map you view is a true and honest representation of that specific slice of your dominion.)

(And notice the colors. They are not random. They are a data layer, a thermal imaging scan of your portfolio's recent activity. Green territories are advancing. Red ones have seen a retreat. This allows you to see, at a single glance, not just the size of your holdings, but their current momentum. It adds a layer of real-time tactical awareness to your strategic overview.)

(This is the difference between a report and an explorer. A report gives you a single, static picture. An explorer gives you a living world and the tools to chart it yourself. It invites you not just to look at your wealth, but to understand its geography, its climate, and its vast, unfolding story.)
