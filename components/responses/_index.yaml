Accepted:
  description: >-
    The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not
    been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and
    may be disallowed when processing occurs. This is typically used for
    asynchronous operations.

          trackingId:

NoContent:
  description: >-
    The server has successfully fulfilled the request and there is no
    additional content to send in the response payload body. This is typically
    used for DELETE operations or PUT operations that update a resource without
    returning its new state.
BadRequest:
  description: >-
    The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is
    perceived to be a client error. This can be caused by malformed request
    syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing. The
    response body will contain details about the specific error(s).
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: INVALID_INPUT
        message: The provided input data is invalid. Please check the request body.
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
Unauthorized:
  description: >-
    The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication
    credentials for the target resource. The client should authenticate and
    retry the request. This response is sent for requests that require
    authentication but where none was provided, or where the provided
    credentials were invalid.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: UNAUTHENTICATED
        message: 'Authentication failed: Invalid or missing access token.'
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
Forbidden:
  description: >-
    The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike a 401
    Unauthorized response, authenticating will make no difference. The client
    is not authorized to perform the requested action on the resource. This may
    be due to insufficient permissions or other access control policies.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: PERMISSION_DENIED
        message: You do not have the required permissions to perform this action.
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
NotFound:
  description: >-
    The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication
    is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. This status
    code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why
    the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: NOT_FOUND
        message: The requested resource could not be found.
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
Conflict:
  description: >-
    The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state
    of the target resource. This code is used in situations where the user might
    be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. For example,
    creating a resource that already exists.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: RESOURCE_CONFLICT
        message: A resource with this identifier already exists or the operation conflicts with an existing state.
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
UnprocessableEntity:
  description: >-
    The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the
    syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to process the
    contained instructions. This is typically used for validation errors. The
    response body should contain details about the validation failures.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: VALIDATION_ERROR

        details:
          - code: FIELD_REQUIRED
            message: The 'name' field is required.
            target: name
          - code: INVALID_FORMAT
            message: The 'email' field must be a valid email address.
            target: email
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
TooManyRequests:
  description: >-
    The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate
    limiting"). The response representations SHOULD include details explaining
    the condition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long to
    wait before making a new request.
  headers:
    Retry-After:
      description: The date-time after which the request may be retried.
      schema:
        type: string
        example: Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT

        seconds.

      example:
        code: RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
        message: You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later.
InternalServerError:
  description: >-
    The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
    fulfilling the request. This error response is a generic "catch-all"
    response. The server logs should contain more details about the error.
    Clients should not retry the same request without modification.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml
      example:
        code: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
        message: An unexpected error occurred on the server. Please contact support
          and provide the request ID.
        requestId: f1g2h3i4-j5k6-7890-1234-567890lmnopq
        timestamp: '2024-07-22T08:00:00Z'
ServiceUnavailable:
  description: >-
    The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary
    overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after
    some delay. The server MAY send a Retry-After header to suggest an
    appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before retrying the
    request.
  headers:
    Retry-After:
      description: The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request.
      schema:
        type: integer
        example: 60

      schema:
        $ref: ../schemas/common/Error.yaml

          try again in a few minutes.
