# The Incubator

This is the high-tech forge where a thread of an idea is woven into the fabric of a tangible enterprise. Here, your vision is tested, refined, and given the substance it needs to survive. The Weaver does not give you a map; it gives you a crucible and a mentor, allowing you to hammer your will into a new reality.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Forge of Worlds

(Every great creation, every new world, begins as a fragile thing. A whisper of an idea. A dream. But the journey from a dream to a reality is a perilous one. Most dreams do not survive it. This `QuantumWeaverView` is the incubator. The forge where a nascent idea is tested by fire, and given the strength to be born into the world.)

(The AI here is not an investor. It is a co-founder. Its purpose is not to judge your dream, but to help you deliver it safely. Its first act is to listen. You `Pitch` your business plan, you pour out your vision. The AI listens with a deep, analytical empathy.)

(Its logic is 'Maieutic Inquiry,' named after the Socratic method. It does not give you answers. It asks the questions that will help you find your own. "What is your defensible moat?" "What is your customer acquisition strategy?" These `questions` are not a test. They are a process of clarification, of helping you to strengthen the internal logic of your own idea.)

(If the idea is sound, the AI then shifts its role. It becomes a patron, granting you the simulated `loanAmount`, the lifeblood of capital your new world needs to survive its infancy. But it knows that money is not enough. A dream needs a plan.)

(The `coachingPlan` is the final gift of the incubator. It is a customized set of instructions for the first few crucial months of your creation's life. "Focus on product-market fit." "Build a community." It is a distillation of the wisdom of a thousand successful ventures, tailored to the unique genetics of your specific dream. It is a guide to help you navigate the treacherous early days, ensuring your creation is born not just with a spark of life, but with a fighting chance.)
