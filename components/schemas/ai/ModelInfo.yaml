  Comprehensive metadata and configuration details for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model.
  This schema provides a standardized way to describe various AI models,
  including Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation models,
  embedding models, speech-to-text models, and more. It's designed to support a wide range of
  model types and their specific characteristics, enabling robust
  discovery, management, and interaction within an AI ecosystem.
  Each field is carefully defined to ensure clarity, machine-readability,
  and compatibility with various tools and platforms.
