title: Algorithm Performance Metrics
description: A comprehensive set of performance metrics for evaluating a trading algorithm's effectiveness and risk profile over a specific period.
type: object
properties:
  pnl:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: "Total Profit and Loss generated by the algorithm over the evaluation period, expressed in the account's base currency."
    example: 15230.55
  return:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The total percentage return on investment (ROI) over the evaluation period. Calculated as (Ending Value - Starting Value) / Starting Value * 100."
    example: 15.23
  sharpe:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The Sharpe ratio, which measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. A higher Sharpe ratio is generally better."
    example: 1.85
  sortino:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The Sortino ratio, a variation of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns."
    example: 2.5
  alpha:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The alpha of the algorithm, representing its ability to beat a benchmark index. It indicates the excess return of the investment relative to the return of a benchmark index."
    example: 0.05
  beta:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The beta of the algorithm, which is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole."
    example: 1.1
  volatility:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The annualized volatility of the algorithm's returns, typically measured as the standard deviation of the returns. Expressed as a percentage."
    example: 22.5
  winRate:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The ratio of winning trades to the total number of trades, expressed as a percentage."
    example: 65.5
  maxDrawdown:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. It is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period, expressed as a percentage."
    example: 12.8
  totalTrades:
    type: integer
    format: int32
    description: The total number of trades executed by the algorithm during the evaluation period.
    example: 258
  profitFactor:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The ratio of gross profits to gross losses. A value greater than 1 indicates a profitable system."
    example: 2.15
  cagr:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The Compound Annual Growth Rate, representing the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year. Expressed as a percentage."
    example: 18.75
  calmarRatio:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: "The Calmar ratio, defined as the compound annualized rate of return divided by the absolute value of its maximum drawdown. Useful for comparing risk-adjusted returns."
    example: 1.46
  averageWin:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: "The average profit on winning trades, expressed in the account's base currency."
    example: 250.75
  averageLoss:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: "The average loss on losing trades, expressed in the account's base currency."
    example: -115.20
