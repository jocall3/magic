type: object
description: |-
  Represents a single, real-time system performance metric captured from the QuantumLeap Analytics platform.
  This object provides a snapshot of a key performance indicator (KPI) at a specific moment, including its current value, recent trend, and an AI-powered prediction for its future state.
  These metrics are fundamental for monitoring system health, detecting anomalies, and performing predictive maintenance.

properties:
  id:
    type: string
    description: A unique, machine-readable identifier for the specific metric being reported (e.g., `cpu-load`, `memory-usage`, `disk-io-write`). This ID is stable and can be used for programmatic lookups and historical data aggregation.
    example: "qcore-load-percent"
  label:
    type: string
    description: A human-friendly, display name for the metric. This is suitable for use in dashboards, reports, and user interfaces.
    example: "Quantum Core Load"
  value:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: The current measured value of the metric. The interpretation of this value depends on the specified `unit`.
    example: 78.5
  unit:
    type: string
    description: The unit of measurement for the `value`. Common units include `%`, `ms`, `GB`, `requests/sec`.
    example: "%"
  trend:
    type: string
    description: An indicator of the metric's recent trajectory. 'up' signifies a consistent increase, 'down' a decrease, and 'stable' indicates minimal fluctuation over the recent observation period.
    enum:
      - up
      - down
      - stable
    example: "up"
  change:
    type: number
    format: float
    description: The percentage change of the metric's value compared to the previous measurement tick. A positive value indicates an increase, while a negative value indicates a decrease.
    example: 2.3
  aiPrediction:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: A predictive forecast of what the metric's value is expected to be in the next measurement interval, generated by the platform's machine learning models. This is crucial for proactive alerting and capacity planning.
    example: 80.1
  subMetrics:
    type: array
    description: An optional list of more granular, constituent metrics that contribute to the primary metric's value. This allows for a detailed drill-down analysis without requiring a separate API call. For example, a total memory usage metric might have sub-metrics for 'application_cache' and 'system_kernel'.
    items:
      type: object
      description: A key-value pair representing a single sub-metric.
      required:
        - label
        - value
      properties:
        label:
          type: string
          description: The human-readable name of the sub-metric.
          example: "Kernel Space Utilization"
        value:
          type: string
          description: The value of the sub-metric. Represented as a string to accommodate diverse data formats (e.g., "15.2%", "1024 MiB", "active").
          example: "13.3%"
  timestamp:
    type: string
    format: date-time
    description: The precise ISO 8601 UTC timestamp indicating when this metric snapshot was recorded.
    example: "2024-05-21T14:35:10.123Z"
